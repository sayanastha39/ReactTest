The App:

The app will be a single page that is split verticallyinto two parts. On the left, there will be an area to type information, and on the right will be results. The idea of this app is that a user can select a template drop a drop down, enter some information, and then hit add. Once submitted, the app will render the information submitted on a graphic chart. on the right side of the screen. The user should be able to enter the same info, select a different template and see that information displayed with the new template on the right side. This app is written in React and I used ChartJS for graphic rendering of the data.
